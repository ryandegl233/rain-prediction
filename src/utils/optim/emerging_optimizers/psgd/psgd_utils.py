    """Balance the dynamic ranges of kronecker factors in place to prevent numerical underflow or overflow.

    Each tensor in `Q_list` is rescaled so that its maximum absolute entry
    becomes the geometric mean of all factors original maxima. This preserves
    the overall product of norms (and thus the scale of the Kronecker product)
    while avoiding numerical underflow or overflow when factors have widely
    differing magnitudes.

    Given tensors :math:`Q_1, Q_2, \\ldots, Q_n`:

    1. Compute max-absolute norms: :math:`\\|Q_i\\|_\\infty = \\max(|Q_i|)` for :math:`i = 1, \\ldots, n`
    2. Compute geometric mean: :math:`g = \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\|Q_i\\|_\\infty \\right)^{1/n}`
    3. Rescale each tensor: :math:`Q_i \\leftarrow Q_i \\cdot \\frac{g}{\\|Q_i\\|_\\infty}`

    This ensures :math:`\\|Q_i\\|_\\infty = g` for all :math:`i`, while preserving the norm of
    the Kronecker product :math:`Q_1 \\otimes Q_2 \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes Q_n`.

    Uses numerically stable subspace iteration with a random initialization that aligns with the

    5. Estimate the norm as the maximum 2-norm among the k vectors, then rescale.
