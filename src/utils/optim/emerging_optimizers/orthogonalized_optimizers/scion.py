class Scion(OrthogonalizedOptimizer):
    """Scion: Stochastic CondItional descent with Operator Norms

    Scion runs standard SGD-momentum and then performs an orthogonalization
    post-processing step, in which each 2D parameter's update is replaced with the nearest orthogonal
    matrix. To efficiently orthogonalize each update, Newton-Schulz iteration is used, which has the
    advantage that it may be stably run on tensor cores on GPUs.

    This implementation incorporates `step_size` and `spectral_radius`, refer to Scion which views weight decay as constrained
    optimization via Frank-Wolfe.

    Warning:
        - This optimizer requires that all parameters passed in are 2D.
        - It should not be used for the embedding layer, the final fully connected layer, or any 1-D
          parameters; those should all be optimized by the appropriate LMO for that layer. For example,
          for 1d params, it is scaled by the `ell_inf` radius.


    Args:
        params: Iterable of parameters to optimize or dicts defining parameter groups
        lr: The learning rate used by the internal SGD.
        momentum_beta: The momentum used by the internal SGD.
        fp32_matmul_prec: Precision of the matmul operations in optimizer states GEMM operations.
        coefficient_type: The type of coefficient set to use for the Newton-Schulz iteration. Can be one of
            ["simple", "quintic", "polar_express"].
        num_ns_steps: The number of iteration steps to use in the Newton-Schulz iteration.
        spectral_radius: The spectral radius to use for the update, we are scaling the LMO by this spectral radius.
